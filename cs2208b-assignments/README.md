Assignments
-----------

- Assignment 1: Written assignment dealing with binary arithmetic, basic computer architecture, etc. (no code written)
- Assignment 2 (Mark received: 106.8%): Basic SPARC assembly programming and using GDB for debugging.
- Assignment 3 (Mark received: 103%): More complex SPARC assembly programming including functions. Implements a Base64 encoder.
- Assignment 4 (Mark received: 117%): Investigating the Java Virtual Machine and writing bytecode. Implements a simple JVM in SPARC assembly and simple bytecode programs.
- Assignment 5 (Mark received: 136%): Investigating assemblers and linkers. A partially completed assembler was provided along with a CPU simulator. The assembler was finished and plugins that were dynamically linked during run time were implemented. Finally simple assembly language programs were created that could be assembled by the custom assembler and run on the custom CPU simulator.
